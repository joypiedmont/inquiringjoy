		<tr style="background-color:DodgerBlue;">
			<td><b>What are the main colors used?</b></td>
			<td> Grey (hex #e6e6e6), red (hex #ff0000), white (hex #ffffff)</td>
		</tr>

		<tr>
			<td> <b>What kind of color combination is used?</b></td>
			<td> None of these? (I put it into Canva’s color wheel and the options for complementary, analogous, and tetradic did not match this).</td>
		</tr>

		<tr style="background-color:DodgerBlue;">
			<td><b>Thinking as a visitor to the site, what effect do the colors have on you? Are they harmonious with the content of the site? Why or why not.</b></td>
			<td>I guess so. There’s not a lot of colors on the site other than the little images of the videos, but there’s so much white and light grey on the homepage that it’s kind of irritating. </td>
		</tr>

		<tr>
			<td><b>Imagine that you're the designer and the website owner asks for a complete redesign. What new colors would you use and why?</b></td>
			<td>Maybe a darker grey for the sidebar. I don’t think drastic color changes are necessary since the website appearance itself is not the main focus of why people visit YouTube, but it would be nice for it too look a bit nicer. </td>
		</tr>
